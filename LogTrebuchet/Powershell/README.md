# Notes

## DCR

The DCR determines which data sources are coming and to which tables it will go

## Script

In the script, make sure to update the dcr immutable ID 

## To Do

- Work on a DCR that handles multiple (if not all) data sources relevant to us. Possibly modify the azuredeploy.json script
- Have a cleaner version of the script:
1. Have it accept the document name by the user
2. Work on making it work with at least 2 tables without having to modify it
